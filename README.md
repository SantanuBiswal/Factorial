# Factorial Using Recursion
#     -> A recursive function is afunction that calls itself with less complex argumentto solve a problem.
#     -> A factorial can be a recursive function bcz the factorial of a larger number can be calculated by multiplying the factorial of smaller number.


             Ex(1). Enter any no.>>> 5
                    Factorial of 5 is = 120
             
             Ex(2)- Enter any no.>>> 10
                    Factorial of 10 is = 3628800
